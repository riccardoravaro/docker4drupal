For a simple implementation of a browser based on an HTTP layer, have a look
at [Goutte](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte).

For an implementation based on HttpKernelInterface, have a look at the
[Client](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/Client.php)
provided by the HttpKernel component.

You can run the unit tests with the following command:

    $ cd path/to/Symfony/Component/BrowserKit/
    $ composer install
    $ phpunit
